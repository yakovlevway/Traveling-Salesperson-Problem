# Traveling-Salesperson-Problem
Although a global solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem does not yet exist, there are algorithms for an existing local solution. There are also necessary and sufficient conditions to determine if a possible solution does exist when one is not given a complete graph. This paper gives an introduction to the Traveling Salesman Problem that includes current research. Additionally, the algorithms are used to find a route traveling through twenty US colleges. As well, we use the Geometric Algorithm to assign scouts for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
